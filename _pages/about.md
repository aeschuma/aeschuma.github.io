Pronouns: _he/him_. Pronunciation: _AW-stin SHOO-mah-ker_

I am an [Assistant Professor](https://depts.washington.edu/healthms/people/austin-schumacher/) in the [Department of Health Metrics Sciences](https://depts.washington.edu/healthms/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) [School of Medicine](https://www.uwmedicine.org/school-of-medicine), as well as the Research Team Lead for the [Population, Fertility, and Mortality Research Team](https://www.healthdata.org/about/people/austin-schumacher) at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org/). I am also a faculty affiliate at the [Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences](https://csss.uw.edu/) and a Biostatistics Consultant for the [Department of Oral Medicine](https://dental.washington.edu/dept-oral-med/) in the [School of Dentristry](https://dental.washington.edu/). I completed my PhD in [Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) under the guidance of [Jon Wakefield](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/).

My passion is developing and implementing statistical methods to solve pressing issues, particularly in global health and topics relating to improving well-being around the world. Within this scope, I have focused on developing statistical modeling frameworks to improve estimation of demographic and health indicators on both global and local scales, and subsequently utilizing this research to increase understanding and ultimately improve lives globally.

I believe intimate knowledge of the local context is imperative in any globally-focused research endeavor---statistical modeling in particular. I prioritize conducting research that is inclusive of diverse perspectives and populations, as incorporating the lived experiences of those affected by the execution and outcomes of research is necessary to reduce biases and maximize beneficial impacts.

When I'm not working, you can find me hanging out with my dog Jayce, playing volleyball (with the [Seattle Riptide](https://www.instagram.com/riptide_mens_volleyball_club/) of the [Volleyball League of America](https://www.usavla.com/), or at various gyms and beaches in the Pacific Northwest), going to music shows, or casually playing Magic: the Gathering.
