Pronouns: _he/him/his_. Pronunciation: _AW-stin SHOO-mah-ker_

I am an [Assistant Professor](https://depts.washington.edu/healthms/people/austin-schumacher/) in the [Department of Health Metrics Sciences](https://depts.washington.edu/healthms/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), as well as the Team Lead for the [Population, Fertility, and Mortality Research Team](https://www.healthdata.org/about/people/austin-schumacher) at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org/). I am also a faculty affiliate at the [Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences](https://csss.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington.

I completed my PhD in [Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) under the guidance of [Jon Wakefield](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/). My dissertation was titled "Modeling multivariate health and demographic outcomes in low- and middle-income countries using sample registration and complex survey data." 

My passion is developing and implementing statistical methods to solve pressing issues particularly in global health, as well as other topics relating to improving health and well-being around the world. Within this general scope of work, I have focused on developing statistical modeling frameworks to improve estimation of demographic and health indicators on both local and global scales, and subsequently utilizing this research to increase understanding and ultimately improve lives globally. 

I believe intimate knowledge of the local context is imperative in any globally-focused research endeavor---statistical modeling in particular. I prioritize conducting research that is inclusive of diverse perspectives and populations, as incorporating the lived experiences of those affected by the execution and outcomes of research is imperative to reduce biases and maximize beneficial impacts.
